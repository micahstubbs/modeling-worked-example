Interested professionals might include a wide range, from infrastructure-focused IT Pros to Developers and Solution, Application or Enterprise Architects, Security practitioners, ""Big Data"" Scientists, and of course business leaders up to C-suite executives wanting to understand the high-level value propositions of the various features that Public Cloud enables in order to properly guide their businesses to ""The Cloud"". We also discuss solutions that 3rd Party (i.e. non-Microsoft) software vendors build on top of Azure to fill in feature gaps (via the Azure <a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/"">Marketplace</a>).</span></p>
<p>No matter your role, we encourage everyone to join us no matter the topic because Public Cloud is the leveler that, for example, means those from a Development background now need to understand more about automated infrastructure than they ever have before, and those with an IT infrastructure background need to understand more about DevOps or Containers than they ever have before. The amount and pace of change that Cloud Computing&nbsp; is bringing about to those in business and Technology is simply unprecedented and this group is one way everyone in the Community can try and keep up with it all.</p>
<p>Each event will focus on just one Azure area or Service or 3rd Party (<a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/"">Marketplace</a>) solution, and typically have a guest speaker, a high-level overview followed by technical demonstration(s), and a Q&amp;A session so we can not only share stories but everyone can learn from each other's experiences.</p>

<p>Movie theatres throughout the Houston-area frequently provide opportunities to see big screen presentations of both classic and cult-classic films (such as Pulp Fiction, Star Wars, the Big Lebowski, etc.). I have attended showings for many of the films listed below. I also plan to check out more screenings in the weeks and months to come, and so should you! I created this group with the hope that us young film fans could meet, greet, and connect through watching great films on the big screen.</p>
<p>These theatrical viewings include the following, among many others: 2001: A Space Odyssey, Ghostbusters, The Godfather (Parts 1&amp; II), The Crow, Lawrence of Arabia, Pulp Fiction, The Shining, Akira, Notorious, Beetlejuice, Clockwork Orange, Bladerunner, Robocop, Eraserhead, Psycho, Alien, Halloween, The Big Lebowski, On the Waterfront, Terminator (1 &amp; 2), Blue Velvet, Fight Club, Star Wars (the original trilogy), North by Northwest, The Thing, Seven Samurai, Citizen Kane, the list goes on…</p>
<p>In addition to seeing re-released classics, group events will also include screenings of smaller/independent films as well as blockbusters. (I love all film!) I will be posting events for film screenings, and I encourage others to do so as well. I’m excited about the connections that we can make through this group, and I look forward to meeting you!</p>
<p>Some minor housekeeping rules:</p>
<p>- Posting Events - Feel free to post events for film showings that interest you. But please make sure you only post about film screenings. (Exceptions of course include meetup spots, such as bars and restaurants, prior to a show.) When you post about an upcoming screening, please do the following: &lt;br&gt; 1.) List the name of the film, show time, theatre, address, and a convenient internet url address for others to conveniently purchase tickets. &lt;br&gt; 2.) Please include a convenient meetup spot so people know where to rendezvous – just to avoid confusion. (It might be fun to meet for coffee and/or drinks prior a screening.) &lt;br&gt; 3.) If you purchase a ticket for an event that includes reserved seating, please list your row and seat number on the page’s message board so others can easily book seats close to you. Also, be sure to check the online board to see where others are sitting. (There’s of course no requirement for everyone to sit with the group.)</p>
<p>- I adhere the to the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema’s “No Texting, Talking, Cell Phone Policy” which you can read at the link below: &lt;br&gt;<a href=""https://drafthouse.com/houston/theater/village/admission"" class=""linkified"">https://drafthouse.com/houston/theater/village/admission</a> &lt;br&gt;We want to be courteous other film-goers. People who have issues with talking, texting, excessive and loud whispering, as well as excessive and obnoxious laughter will be removed from the group.</p>
<p>- As the name of this meetup indicates this is a young adults’ group. Please only attend if you’re under 40. I don’t have issues with people 40+. I’m just trying to keep a young adult vibe.</p>
<p>If this all sounds exciting, please sign up to attend a film screening! Don’t be shy – we’d love to get to know you!</p>","Richard",170722082

We will host social events like dinner, movie, concert, bowling, game night, guys/girls night out, and really explore what Houston and the surrounding areas has to offer! But in addition to entertainment, we will also host volunteer/charity events. We believe that, by being together, we can encourage and inspire one another to live faithfully in His way <i>(Hebrews 10:24-25)</i>.</span> <br></p>
<p><span>All are welcome, even non-believers who are interested in exploring the belief! This club is not an initiative of any particular Church, but rather we are individuals of different background who are all committed to Christ (we actually met through Meetup.com!).</span></p>
<p><span><b>WHY DOES CSC EXIST? </b> <br>Aside from Church on the weekends or occasional Bible studies, many Christians can find themselves alone against the wickedness of this world for most days of the week. Though there are over 2 billion Christians today, the many walking amongst us in our daily lives are merely self-proclaimed (Matthew 7:21-23). Nowadays it's easier to get lost and drift astray than to fully commit in the Way. This club exist to help fill the void especially for those not having fellow devoted Christians around in a more ""normal"" or ""regular"" setting (i.e. outside of Church), and to provide fun social outing&nbsp;options that preserve Holy living.</span></p>
<p><b>MISSION:</b> <br><span>(1.) To connect devoted Christians with one another so that all can be inspired to live a righteous lifestyle and serve God regularly in accordance to the Scripture. <br></span><span>(2.) To help the ""lone"" believer(s) realize the strength and importance of the ""Body"" of Christ. <br>(3.) To provide a safe and supportive environment to discuss the Truth.</span></p>
<p><b>VISION: </b> <br> To take part in building up as many believers as possible so that they can become the ""light of the world"" spreading joy, peace, love and Truth throughout. In turn, the ultimate hope is that all others will see the light and believe that Jesus is the Way.</p>
<p><span><b>WE'RE ALWAYS SEEKING VOLUNTEER ORGANIZERS!:&nbsp;</b> <br></span><span>We know that our vision is BIG, but it is something we believe so highly in! We will definitely need help in reaching our goals.&nbsp;If you are interested in volunteering to set up event(s), let us (organizers) know!
