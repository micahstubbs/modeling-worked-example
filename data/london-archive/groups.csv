<p><b>Does The Hyperledger Project have the potential to become the engine behind most successful decentralized applications and organizations created in the next 25-50 years? Absolutely! </b></p>
<p>A much better question is how, and in what new ways, can we: </p>
<p>a) Build decentralized applications, organizations and APIs at 10x the speed at 1/10 the cost.</p>
<p>b) Build situational awareness in the local community.</p>
<p>I believe that the convergence of decentralized applications, decentralized organizations, artificial intelligence and IoT brings upon us the Great Displacement of the 21st century, where the majority of workforce will be left without “conventional” jobs, forced to learn new skills and professions. </p>
<p><b>Why? </b></p>
<p>Founders of this group believe that the Hyperledger Foundation will be the engine behind decentralization of the world, a massive economic change of the next 25-50 years. </p>
<p>So.... why don't we standardize and democratize the field with and around Hyperledger? </p>
<p><b>What?</b></p>
<p>We are a local micro community of those interested in advancing their knowledge of Hyperledger, its use cases and applications. </p>
<p><b>How?</b></p>
<p>Join our group for a regular dose of human interaction, conversations, smiles, food and drinks on all things Hyperledger: </p>
<p>• Use Cases</p>
<p>• Competitive analysis of Hyperledger startups (Distributed Apps from disruptive companies in specific vertical markets)</p>
<p>• How-To’s </p>
<p>• Interviews with individuals working at the edge of the Hyperledger project</p>
<p>• Reviews of tools, services and APIs offered by the Hyperledger ecosystem</p>
<p>• Best Practices in Application Architecture</p>
<p>• Do’s and Don’ts </p>
<p>• Application Templates</p>
<p>• Hackathons</p>
<p>• Security in the decentralized world - on the edge, on the node, in the cloud and in transit</p>
<p>• How others solve some of the hard problems that exist in the world using Hyperledger.</p>
<p><b> <br></b></p>

Yet throughout the pre-referendum campaigns and aftermath of Brexit many questions remain unanswered and the future unclear.</p>
<p>We are calling developers, activists, product managers, data scientists, UX designers, systems architects, or anyone passionate about change, to join forces to create positive dialogue and action beyond Brexit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Started as a collaboration between ThoughtWorks, Code First: Girls and WeRockTech, we ran a successful hackathon event in July to bring together technical and non-tech people to create solutions that drive dialogue, unity and positive action in a post-EU Referendum Britain. During that weekend we built ten open-source projects that were designed to create a more open dialogue between the opposing sides of the Brexit argument and answer questions the UK public have as a result of the decision to leave the EU. </p>
<p>You can see the projects at: <a href=""http://hackbrexit.org/"">http://hackbrexit.org/</a> </p>
<p>Since July, we have started an open-source accelerator programme for two of these projects; ‘Ministers under the Influence’ and ‘What the Fact’. A rolling, three-month accelerator programme will support and scale up these projects so that they have a clear and positive impact on society. We plan to run more meetups and hackathons in order to develop these projects further and create a pipeline of other projects that will bring society together and solve many of the issues facing politics and government.</p>
<p>We've been covered by <a href=""http://www.computerweekly.com/news/450301594/ThoughtWorks-runs-tech-hackathon-to-provide-post-Brexit-support-to-public"">Computer Weekly</a> and mentioned by <a href=""http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=154828"">IQ Business</a> who described Hack Brexit as ""a perfect example"" of how to engage the British people.</p>

After all many smart women and men born in the last millennia have grappled with what in the field of social science has been labeled the turn to complexity. <br></p>
<p>Other fields of science did their turn: in math we have complexity and chaos theory, in physics vast universes with barely countable particles in quantum entanglement defying determinism and leaving space for new theories, philosophy is wondering over dualisms or monoisms, the force of life, and question if it’s not better to return from the lingual to more embodied concepts. In psychology, with its many theories of the mind, seemingly rational thoughts, prove to be born of fast but not so precise automatisms, and memories a construct of constant renarration. The military strategize along VUCA concepts, and business theory is following close. <br></p>
<p>We all know of globalisation, climate change, migration, shifts in power and maybe of network effects, system theories, process and flow, power laws, the third industrial revolution, and co-evolution of (cyborg) humans and machines. Something is in flux, it does affect us, and in our eyes it is worthwhile to learn more about. <br></p>
<p>Our intention for this group is to find people who are interested in the “arrival” of awareness of complexity in everyday sensemaking. How does it affect you and me, our family and friends? Do we need to/Could we do something to provide guidance? How does the combination of thoughtful intend and the making of things (“thinkering”) can be used to understand the confusing topic? How could we use physical and digital tools for teaching, learning, experiencing, and navigating in a world of processes and flow? <br></p>
<p>It would be great to meet a interdisciplinary group of people, bridging silos of profession and approach. Thus artists, designers, coders, scientists, writers, thinkers, tinkerers, or simply curious join us to explore the ways how our daily life looks like looking from the angle of complexity. <br></p>
<p>We will organise events to share ideas, thoughts, and plan to come up with playful practical investigation methods into the topic. <br></p>
<p>Potential activities could be: presentations, exhibition visits and reviews, or practical explorations like making topic relevant physical or digital things together. How about the Confused? the app to make decisions, map making, learning tools to viscerally understand probabilities, a chaos pendulum, or discuss how complexity can be expressed visually without falling into visual tropes such as the fractal used above. <br></p>
<p>Please join and we will then be able to discuss real world meetup and other things to do. </p>

<p>What becomes possible tomorrow is super exciting and scary at the same time.

<p><b>B.U.I.L.D</b>&nbsp;(Businesses United​ ​for Innovation, Learning and Development)&nbsp;is set up to offer more opportunities for people with an entrepreneurial mindset to learn from each other and build successful businesses. Together.</p>
<p>Why join&nbsp;<b>B.U.I.L.D</b>?</p>
<p>If you are looking to participate in events like workshops, trainings, lectures, seminars, hackathons aiming to transform you and your business for success and you consider yourself a business B.U.I.L.D:er, it would be foolish of you not to join this group.</p>
<p><b>A business B.U.I.L.D:er is:</b></p>
<p>·&nbsp; anyone who wants to build a successful business;</p>
<p>·&nbsp; somebody who has an entrepreneurial mindset = often drawn to opportunities, innovation, new value creation and willing to take risks</p>
<p>·&nbsp; an employee curious about starting a business or wanting to apply entrepreneurial thinking at his/her workplace.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; a smart manager or business owner looking for innovation ideas,</p>
<p>·&nbsp; an edgy consultant, freelancer or solopreneur</p>
<p>·&nbsp; a student or researcher with an entrepreneurship interest</p>
<p>Do you see value and opportunities in networking and want business dreams to come true in mutually beneficial ways? Invest in yourself and a more entrepreneurial world today and come along!</p>
<p><b>What is a B.U.I.L.D event?</b></p>
<p>B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;events can be about sales, marketing, branding, customer engagement, self development, finance, law, growth hacking and any other topic which in one way or another can help businesses become more awesome.</p>
<p><b>Become an event organizer</b></p>
<p>•&nbsp;You can attend events and benefit from networking with likeminded. However,&nbsp;<b>your benefits can be massive if you organize these events yourself</b>. Events and Meetup groups are a great way to get:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;connections</p>
<p>•&nbsp;promote your services and expertise</p>
<p>•&nbsp;goodwill&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;test ideas</p>
<p>•&nbsp;feedback</p>
<p>•&nbsp;referrals&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;introductions</p>
<p>Being part of a bigger organization and group opens more doors than going about it alone. B.U.I.L.D exists in 11 cities in Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running a successful Meetup-group also requires, much like a business, grit and a lot of time, dedication and effort. What if you could go in lean and test your session by organizing only one event?</p>
<p>We at B.U.I.L.D give you a chance to organize just one event (or more in the future) under the B.U.I.L.D. brand with its existing members instead of starting your own Meetup group from scratch.</p>
<p><b>How to apply</b></p>
<p>If you would like to promote your service by sharing your knowledge and expertise with other professionals and entrepreneurs with a workshop or get-together; apply to get your event published and promoted by contacting EntAnon's Community Manager Jenny via e-mail on jenny.bjorklof@entanon.com. You get support on how to organize great B.U.I.L.D events by experienced business event organizers.</p>
<p>Please note: Free events = free support, paid events = agreed profit share on a case to case basis.</p>
<p><b>The history of B.U.I.L.D</b></p>
<p>B.U.I.L.D is a brand by EntAnon (short for Entrepreneurs Anonymous). In 2015 more than 30 thought provoking events were organized by EntAnon and B.U.I.L.D (that is at least one event every second week) engaging thousands of members. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The name Entrepreneurs Anonymous could stand for being addicted to Entrepreneurship and having an urgent need to get group support for it. But actually Entrepreneurs Anonymous is more about providing a safe place with like-minded people where entrepreneurship can be explored. Here Entrepreneurs-to-be and undercover entrepreneurs from corporates have been spotted too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs Anonymous events started in Dublin, Ireland in 2011 as accountability group by former students of an entrepreneurship course. The interest for the group grew and now social events with guest speakers are organized every last Tuesday of the month. With a membership increase by 10% each month it was quickly realized last Tuesday-events were simply just not enough for the Anonymous Entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;was set up to offer more opportunities for Entrepreneurs to learn from each other. So far&nbsp;B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;events like the Gigonomy Panel discussion, Speed Business Networking and the Free Business Clinic have been organized. B.U.I.L.D also organizes former DDM events. These are events for people especially interested in Data Driven Marketing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>More about B.U.I.L.D and DDM Alliance</b></p>
<p>EntAnon's brand&nbsp;​​B.U.I.L.D partnered&nbsp;​ with the former Data Driven Marketing Alliance (DDM). Future ​DDM&nbsp;​meetups and other events in Copenhagen, Berlin, Belgium, Dublin,&nbsp;Dusseldorf, Helsinki, London, Manchester, Netherlands, Paris,&nbsp;Stockholm, ​soon ​Milano​ and other parts of Europe will be organized together with B.U.I.L.D. DDM representatives​ can&nbsp;​set up online events​ ​(webinars and conferences) and&nbsp;use the B.U.I.L.D. groups around Europe ​as ​​a channel.&nbsp;If another B.U​.​I​.​L​.​D or EntAnon​ ​event is set on the same date the organizers agree​ ​on the next best date for the&nbsp;DDM&nbsp;Alliance event to take​ ​place.</p>","EntAnon",193727111

</p>
<p>&ldquo;The social and political space where things get done and where people have a sense of belonging and have an element of control over their lives, providing sustenance, security and independence... Commons are organized around resources that are collectively owned or shared between or among populations. These resources are said to be held in common and can include everything from natural resources to domains of the cultural sphere, e.g.: literature, music, arts, design, film, video, television, radio, information, software and sites of heritage. The commons can also include &lsquo;public goods&rsquo; such as public space, public education, health and the infrastructure that allows our society to function (such as electricity or water delivery systems). There also exists the &lsquo;life commons&rsquo;, e.g. the human genome.&rdquo; (Wikipedia)</p>

The challenges this meetup group will consider, is how to extend and improve the functionality of these systems.  At the same time, enhancing the careers of those who do consider such improvements. The areas that I am thinking of are;

1. Virtualization.  How practical is it?  What are the software issues?
2. Re-Platforming. i.e. keep the object code, but move to a new platform, e.g. Linux. 
3. What tools would we lose in both of the above? What could we replace them with?
4. How do we re-tool ourselves, to move from a z/OS environment , to a Linux or Windows environment?
5. Security. Of the underlying platform, operating system, data, and moving to a new commodity, and open environment.
6. Does anyone have anything they can demonstrate?
7. Any burning issues?

We will invite technology partners to speak and include related organisations such as Microsoft, AWS, and other public cloud providers to share their stories too. With 2700 CSP partners worldwide, what matters is that you're talking about Desktop as a Service (DaaS) and related topics that are interesting and important to you. This is not a sales pitch, this is an information sharing and updating opportunity for the community to gather as they need and grow their businesses. The group will also present updates on other events organised by relevant groups, vendors and partners which can help you. We invite specialists and new technologies to present about innovative technology solutions.

Well, it's time to get off the Internet and tell us about it face to face. We'll provide you with our honest feedback, you provide us with a great hack, or idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll give you 5 minutes to show off your tool, hack, library (did you just write a library to access the Meetup API in Go!?), whatever. We're language and software/hardware agnostic, so it's all fair game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you present, it's an open forum. The audience will ask questions and provide feedback. We want to enable as much participation as possible at these meetups, so you'd better be able to take criticism and dish it out (all within reason of course). N.B. personal projects only, no idea or startup pitching, no commercial plugs!</p>
<p>We're the newly formed London chapter of the multi-city Hack &amp;&amp; Tell meetup movement. Show us some love by becoming a member and following us on Twitter (@hackandtellLDN).</p>","Zoe Jervier",182603391

I started this group because the future of computing is Cloud and SoftLayer will play a massive part in that future. Looking forward to exploring the potentials for SoftLayer with everybody.</p>","Jon Walsh",182504347
